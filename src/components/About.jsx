					<h2>My Journey</h2>
					<p>
						With over <strong>[X]</strong> years of experience in web
						development, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with diverse clients
						and projects. My journey began with a curiosity for how websites
						work, which evolved into a passion for creating digital experiences
						that make a difference.
					</p>
					<p>
						I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly applications
						using modern technologies. Whether it's a simple landing page or a
						complex web app, I approach each project with attention to detail
						and a commitment to quality.
